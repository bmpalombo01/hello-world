# hello-world
This is my learn how repository

I'm an old fart, but not too old that I can't learn some new things.  
I'm a retired Network Engineer and I've a very tiny bit of coding experience. 
I am familiar with version control and I hope to use GitHub to help me write a book and a blog or two.  
Wish me well.
